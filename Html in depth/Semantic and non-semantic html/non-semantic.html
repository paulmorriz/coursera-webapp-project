<!--Please note that this example uses 
non-semantic HTML tags such as <table>, 
 <tr>, <td>, and <h1>, <h2>, <h3> for 
 layout purposes only, which is not 
 recommended in modern web development. 
 It's best practice to use semantic HTML 
 tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, 
<section>, <article>, <aside>, 
<footer> to provide meaningful
structure and improve accessibility 
 and SEO.-->
